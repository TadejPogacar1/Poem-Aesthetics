## Overview

This project investigates the concept of **"Universal Aesthetics"** within the context of Artificial Intelligence models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Our central hypothesis is inspired by Tolstoy's famous opening line: *"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" — but applied to AI representations. 

### Key Findings

This study validates the **Platonic Representation Hypothesis** on aesthetic data and provides insights into how aesthetic factors influence model alignment and representation space. Our findings suggest that aesthetic attributes, rather than being complex or high-level features, may be **fundamental elements mastered relatively early** in a model's training process.

### Key Components

#### `image2poem/` and `platonic/`
These directories contain modified versions of external codebases:
- **image2poem**: Adapted for poem generation from images
- **platonic**: Modified Platonic Representation code with custom:
  - Data loading mechanisms
  - Model lists for LLMs and ViTs
  - Feature extraction pipelines

**Note**: These are based on existing works with modifications specific to our experiments.

#### `poems/`
Contains all dataset creation code:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Poem filtering and selection
- Aesthetic scoring
- Image-text/image-poem pairing

#### `representations/`
All analysis and visualization code:
- **`main.py`**: Central script to compute alignment scores with different configurations
- Feature extraction and analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization generation (heatmaps, boxplots, scatter plots)
